# AutoclickCookieClicker-v1.0
Limited autoclick for cookie clicker game with selenium in python

This is my first project with selenium, a very simple one just for fun

The cookie from the game will be clicked automaticaly 1 000 000 times, and when there are enough cookies, 
the first product from the shop (the one that looks like a hand with the pointing finger up) will be bought.

After 1 milion clicks, the window with the game will close automaticaly.

Cheers!
